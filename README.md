#PyBank

This file reads a csv file with dates and profit/losses. It then loops through the data to determine how many months are represented in the csv file, the net total profit/loss from the dataset, the average profit/loss, the month with the greatest profit and loss. This information is then printed to the terminal and written into a new text file in the analysis folder within the directory.


#PyPoll

This file reads through a csv file contaning voter information and candidate voted for. It then loops through the data and counts the total votes per candidate, saved in a dictionary. This saved data is then used to determine total number of votes in the election, list the candidates with the number of votes for them and the percentage of the total votes that is, and determine a winner based on popular vote. This information is then printed to the terminal and saved in a new text file in the analysis folder within the directory.
